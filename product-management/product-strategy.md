### Questions for PMs

- At it's core, product management is about identifying and defining problems facing users and their needs.
  - In addition, they need to know their product and their competition.
- PMs must answer: **What** are we building?
  - What does the product do, do people _want_ it, and what _value_ does it provide?
- **Who** is the product being built for? What are their specific needs?
  - Eg. If you're building a calculator, it's going to look vastly different if built for a grade schooler vs. a scientist.
- **Why** are you solving this this problem, and why are we building this specific solution?
  - What is the impact?
  - How does it have both user-value and meet business objectives?
  - It's also important to be able to communicate to the team why you're building this over something else.
- **When** is this being built?
  - Unfortunately, you can't build everything at once, so it's important to udnerstand and priortize what to build exactly now, and what to put on the roadmap for later.
- Having compelling answers to all these questions will not only move the project forward, it will also get people excited to work on it.
  - You have to be mindful of answering these questions in a _strategic_ manner that tie back to business goals and objectives, while also creating a cohesive narrative around the product and the company.

### Skills of a PM

- PMs must create a good **strategy** for building and bringing successful products to market.
  - In addition to having both focus and intution around a user's needs and how they're respond to changes or updates to products.
- They also must be able to map out the steps needed to be taken in order to get the product to its full potential and vision
  - And, along the way while doing this, course-correct when new information arises,
- PMs are constantly **comunicating** out and responding to questions, they are the source of truth for the company and the product.
  - They need to be able to speak to multiple audiences, including the design team, engineers, exectuives, and customers.
- PMs also require **coordination**, and act as the glue that hold companies together.
  - With _end-to-end visibility_, they're in the only role that sees the product through the entirity of the development process.
  - Design might not be aware of what marketing is working on, and vice-versa.
- PMs are required to also **respond** to a consistent flow of new information, and decide what to do.
  - Whether that's results from a user-study, a new product from a competitor, or an e-mail from the CEO.
- Finally, PMs are also responsibile to **mitigate crisis**, and constantly think on their feet and tackle new issues as they come up.

### Purpose of Product Management

- Bringing productsa to market is more complciate than ever.
  - It's easy to build products that fail, but really hard to build something marketable.
- There's a need for someone to focus on the user and the problem.
  - This ensures the team does not lose sight on the important things that really matter.
- Aligning the team and orchestrating movement in the same direction.
  - Advocate for users, understand the business, empower design, create stability for engineers.
  - While at the same time getting people excited for the product and focused on what's important.
- It's important to make sure you're not only finding a problem to solve, but the _right_ problem.
  - Not all problems will lead to succesful products.
  - AKA Real problems for real users.
- For example, _Google Glass_ was an incredible innovation, but ultimately failed because no direct problem for users was being solved.

### History of Project Management

**1931 - Neil McElroy and "Brand Men"**

Neil McElroy wrote a memo called "Brand Men" while at Procter & Gamble. This memo touched on two parts of this new role that carried into product management:

- **“Full responsibility”** - Product managers are responsible for the success of their product. They need to work across multiple teams in order to achieve their goals and build great products.
- **“Studying things personally at first hand”** - Getting out of the building, seeing problems first hand, and interacting with users is a critical part of the product management role. This experience will provide you with deep insights and build empathy for your users.

**1930s - Bill Hewlett and David Packard**

These two entrepreneurs met while at Stanford. McElroy was an advisor of theirs and they were deeply influenced by him. They went on to found Hewlett-Packard in 1939. And one of HP’s key strategies was to _put decision making as close to the customer as possible_. Being close to your customers and understanding their needs is a core part of product management.

**1960s - Japan**

After World War II, just-in-time manufacturing became common in Japan. In addition to reducing waste during the production process, there were also two important principles:

- **Kaizen**: change for better - continuously improving the business while always driving for innovation and evolution. Today you see Product Managers driving constant improvements and optimizations for their products.
- **Genchi genbutsu** - real location, real thing - This means going to the source to find the facts to make correct decisions. This is again, highlighting the importance for Product Managers to get out of the building and experience everything first hand.

Product Managers originally started in the marketing function and focused on making sure the product is in the right place, at the right price, with the right promotion. As tech began to create giant new industries, it became crucial that products were developed to more deeply meet user needs.

When looking at the **4 P's of Marketing**, Place, Price, and Promotion are under the role of _brand management_.

## Role of Product Management

- At the end of the day, the role of a product manager is to make sure the team is solving the right problems, and successfully building products that people want.
- In order to achieve this, the PM is positioned at the center of: Design, Business, and Technology.
  - **Design** is to look at user needs, motives, and advocate for them.
  - **Business** is to align the product goals to the business objectives.
  - **Technology** is to understand how the product is built, as well as understanding complexity, risks, and tradeoffs.
- PMs need to be able to _influence without authority_, as they don't usually have actual control over any particular team.
- - Solving problems might make the product more appealing to users.
    - It has the potential to increase sales.
    - It reduces user churn, and keeps the company competitive.
    - It also can increase the team's efficiency.
    - Or, it might be legally required if you want to continue selling the product.
- Regarding prioritization, **stack ranked lists** can help numerate different features more precisely.

### Differences in Roles

- The role of a PM can vary a lot based on the company and product.
  - The size of a company has a big impact on the scope of a PMs work.
- At smaller companies it's more likely that PMs will have more end to end responsibility and wear more hats.
  - There will be less support and process, and overall more ownership.
- At larger companies oftentimes there will be larger supporting teams, which allow PMs to maintain a narrow focus and go super deep on that specific area.

A company’s philosophy to building products also shapes the role of a PM. The most common philosophies:

- **Product led:** Solving problems for users, focusing on understanding and writing requirements.
  - Research is done through talking and studying users.
  - Then, once engineering has the requirements, they will build.
  - While this is a customer-centered approach, there might be a lack of empathy from non-customer facing teams.
- **Engineering led:** Engineers solve a technical problem, and the PM brings it to marketing.
  - This promotes technical innovation, and sometimes, customers don't really know what they want, until they have it.
  - However, this increases the possibility that the product won't resonate with the customer.
- **Product + Engineering partnership:** PMs write the requirements, but engineering is included in identifying them.
  - Engineering then builds based on requirements, but the PM is included in the Eng Design.

### Type of User

- Consumers mean focusing on user problems and providing value.
  - Customer-facing products require a simple, clean UX design.
  - The user is likely the person who purchases the product.
- On the other hand, for enterprise products, the focus is both on the user and the business problems.
  - The bulk of the value is provided to the company, and some value to the user.
  - And, ultimately, it's the company that decides to purchase the product, even though the employees will be using it.
  - In these types of environments, the user and the customer are not the same.
  - There are usually a lot more problems for PMs to identify any requirements to manage, thus creating slower iteration and development.

### Types of Products

- **Software** products require PMs to really focus on UX and will also need to understand roll-out cycles and processes like App Store reviews.
- **Hardware** products focus on components, capabilities, cost, and the supply chain.
  - In addition to shipping certification, factory lines, and import implications.
  - Physical products also cannot be updated nearly as easily as digital ones, meaning there's more emphasis on getting things right the first time.
- **Data** products are used for researching and possibly machine learning, getting super deep into data and numbers.
  - The goal being to figure out how to build a product on top of a _lot_ of data.
  - Eg. Self-driving cars or Netflix recommendations.
- **Growth** is where PMs focus on accelerating the product through features that drive adaptability, either directly or indirectly.
  - The focus being on getting new users and having a deep understanding of their funnel optimization.
- **Internationalization** is the focus on bringing the product to new places.
  - This means deeply understanding the differences in those markets, user behaviour and expectations, and adopting the product to fit.
  - This also includes adaptions such as adding support to right-to-left languages in UI or creating systems that can customize content in an app based on location.
  - Some markets might also have additional requirements that must be met before the product can be launched there.

### What Project Managers Do

- Finding the problem (Understand, Identify, Define)
  - This one of the most important things that a PM does.
  - Understanding the user and their needs, as well as the space that the product will be in.
  - Conducting market, user, or competitive research to leverage existing product insights and data or other inputs to create hypotheses and test them.
- Creating strategy, once armed with an understanding of the problem space and opportunity.
  - PMs can build strategies for how to solve the problem through the creation of their product.
  - Creating a high-level overview of the product, features and what it does.
  - As well as how it maps to goals, objectives, and KPIs.
- Once the problem and requirements have been identified, then planning begins to figure out how to tackle the work.
  - This usually involves working with design and engineering to figure out how much time is needed to both design and build the product.
  - For larger products that will take a longer time to ship, it can be helpful to break things down into **milestones**.
  - It is also important to identify key points of contact in both design and engineering that will be working with you as PM.
- During UX design, it's super important to focus on building out mocks and the spec for the user-experience.
  - Your role as PM is to provide context that can help inform design decisions.
